# K-Means Image Compression and Viewer

This project implements a K-Means clustering-based image compression tool with an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). Users can view and compress images by selecting the number of clusters for compression, switch between different images, and explore the effects of compression interactively.

## Features
- **Image Compression**: Uses K-Means clustering to compress images by reducing the number of colors.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with `matplotlib`, allowing users to:
  - Adjust the number of clusters with a slider.
  - Navigate between multiple images using "Next" and "Previous" buttons.
- **Customizable**: Supports any set of image files specified by the user.
